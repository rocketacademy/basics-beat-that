    1. There are 2 players and players take turns.<br><br>
    2. When a player clicks Submit, the game rolls 2 dice and shows the dice rolls,<br>for example 3 and 6.<br><br>
    3. The player picks the order of the dice they want. For example, if they wanted the number 63, they would specify that the 2nd dice goes first.<br><br>
    4. After both players have rolled and chosen dice order, the player with the higher combined number wins.<br><br>
