/*
===== REQUIREMENTS =====
1) There are 2 players and each would take turns
2) When a player clicks submit, the game rolls 2 dice and shows the dice rolls, for example 3 and 6
3) The play picks the order of the dice they want. For example, if they wanted the number 63, they would specify that the 2nd dice goes first
4) After both players have rolled and chosen dice order, the player with the higher combined number wons

===== Problem breakdown and Planning =====
Ver 1. Rolls 2 dice and turns the output for 1 player. That player chooses the dice order and get the correct return output
Ver 2. Refactored code to include player 2
  - Global variables for currentPlayer; allPlayersScore
  - Refactor outputMessages to interact with each player, 1 and 2
  - Write logic for player 1 to go first then player 2, and finally point towards comparing score

Ver 3. Implement comparing dice scores and declare winner
Ver 4. Reset the game so that players can play continually without refreshing the browser page
