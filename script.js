/* Beat that game!
Logic for this game: 
-2 players will roll two dices. 
- For example, if player 1 rolls 1 and 6, they can afterwards choose either dice 1 or dice 2 to form a number.If player 1 chooses the second dice, the number will be 61 or 16 if player had chosen the first dice. 
- This is repeated for Player 2. 
- whoever has the highest number wins the game

The first game state being for the player to roll the dice and the second game state to choose the dice order.
