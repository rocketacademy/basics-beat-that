// Project 2 : Beat that (Base)//

// 1. Number of players = 2 , will take turns to play the game
// Create a prompt to inform player to click on submit button.

// 2. When a player clicks Submit, the game rolls 2 dice and shows the dice rolls, for example 3 and 6. The dice values should be stored for each player.

// 3. The player picks the order of the dice they want. (e.g whether dice 1 or dice 2 will go first) -> conditional statement. Store the value in an array

// 4. After both players have rolled and chosen dice order, the player with the higher combined number wins. -> to compare the 2 dice value

// 5. The game will reset and will go back to Player 1
