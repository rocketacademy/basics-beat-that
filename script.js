// 2 players taking turns
//player clicks submit, the game rolls 2 dice.
//output is the 2 numbers of the dice rolls (random), example 3 and 6
// the player picks the order of the dice they want (or can we automatically choose from the player?)
// player 2 turns
// winner determined (the higher combined number)

// FIRST STEP -- input: submit. output: 2 numbers from random dice.

// SECOND STEP -- include player 2.
//   1. Global variables for currentPlayer; allPlayersScore
//   2. Refactor myOutputMessage to interact with each player,1 and 2
//   3. write logic for player 1 to go first then player 2
//   4. comparing score and final winner

// THIRD STEP -- Game is plating continuesly without needing to refresh the page
