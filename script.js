//====Requirements=====//

//1) there are 2 players and players take turns
//2) when a player clicks submit, the game rolls 2 dice and shows the dice rolls, eg. 3 and 6
//3) the player picks the order of the dice they want. Eg. if they wanted the number 63, they would specify that the 2nd dice goes first
//4) after both players have rolled and chosen dice order, the player with the higher combined number wins


//==== problem breakdown and planning =====//
//ver 1. rolls 2 dice and turns the output for 1 player. That player chooses the dice order and gets the correct return output.
// ver 2. refactored code to include Player 2 
//    - need global variables to keep track of the current player
//    - refactor outputMessages to interact with each player, 1 and 2, and finally point towards comparing score
//    - write logic for player 1 to go first then player 2
//ver 3. implementing comparing dice scores and declare the winner
// ver 4. reset the game so that the players can play continually without refreshing the browser page
