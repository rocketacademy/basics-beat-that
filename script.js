// 2 player game //
// when player clicks submit, the game rolls 2 dice
// player chooses the order of which number from the rolled dice that will go first
// player with the higher number combination wins

// breakdown //
// roll dice twice and show output to player for them to choose
// output chosen combination number to player
// refactor code to include player 2
// compare both dice value from each player, the higher number wins
// reset the game

/*
step 1: create a dice roll function (output only 2 number)
step 2: create a select number function (input the result into an array to compare with next player's choice)
step 3: create a second player game mode
step 4: create a game result function (compare both player's results, the number with the bigger value wins)
step 5: create a reset game mode
