// Completeness Level (1-5):

// What did you think of this deliverable?
// I tried. However I feel like i am limited to what I can do because I don't know too much.
// Is there anything in this code that you feel pleased about?
// I have the ability to set the dice amounts in this game

// There are 2 players and players take turns.
// When a player clicks Submit, the game rolls 2 dice and shows the dice rolls, for example 3 and 6.
// The player picks the order of the dice they want. For example, if they wanted the number 63, they would specify that the 2nd dice goes first. You can choose how the player specifies dice order.
// After both players have rolled and chosen dice order, the player with the higher combined number wins.
//
// plan:
// gameState 0 should be default and show nothing, but click submit to start rolling to p1
// gameState 1, 3should show you Player's rolls and asks you to key in option 1 or option 2
// gameState 2, 4 should show u the result of the corresponding player. it then proceeds to start the next roll
// gameState 5 should be a winner screen, comparing the results, then submitting again should send back to state 0
