// BEAT THAT - VARIABLE PLAYERS VERSION
// Done by: Yiu Han Kit, Basics 15-2
// Allow more than 2 players at a time to play Beat That. At the beginning of the game, ask how many players would like to play. For a variable number of players, feel free to output the leaderboard in any order, because implementing the leaderboard in decreasing order requires advanced logic.

// gameState 0 = Blockscreen/ Welcome screen, take no of players
// gameState 1 = username input
// gameState 2 = [MAIN GAME] diceroll state
// gameState 3 = [MAIN GAME] user choose order of dice
// gameState 4 = compilation of results

var gameState = 0; // Refer to gameState list above
var noOfPlayers = 0; // User input to determine number of players
var playerCount = 0; // Related to gameState 2 and 3, while loop function
var playerNames = []; // To store player names
var playerDiceResult = []; // To store player results

// diceRoll function for game
