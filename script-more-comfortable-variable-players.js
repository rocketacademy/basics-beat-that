// Variable Number of Dice
// Create a new version of Beat That that rolls two or more dice per player.
// At the beginning of each round, ask the players how many dice they would like to play with. Both players will roll the same number of dice each round.
// Store each player's dice rolls in an array. When each player rolls dice, use a loop to place n dice roll values in that player's array, where n is the number of dice the players specified at the beginning of the round. Output each player's dice roll values.
// Auto-generate the optimal combined number based on each player's dice rolls to determine the winner of that round.

/* Variable Number of Players
Allow more than 2 players at a time to play Beat That. At the beginning of the game, ask how many players would like to play. For a variable number of players, feel free to output the leaderboard in any order, because implementing the leaderboard in decreasing order requires advanced logic.

Current beat that is:
- ask for normal or lowest game mode
- how many dice to roll
- then auto-generate the numbers 
- and compare who wins

- input is the numOfPlayers
- for each player, roll the number of dice selected
- need a way to refer back to each player's rolls

- use double for loop
- inner for loop is to roll the number of dices specified
- outer for loop will then do the inner loop for how many players specified

Flow of program will be:
0. chooseGameMode
1. selectNumOfPlayers
2. rollDice
3. generateNums
4. checkResult

0. change ending gameState to "selectNumOfPlayers"

1. selectNumOfPlayers
- create global var numOfPlayers so we can access it in rollDice game state
- user validation use the same one as rollDice cos we only want numbers min. value 2
- numOfPlayers = input;
- output how many players selected. Next, input the number of dice to roll

2. rollDice
- change the code in the else block
- create global var everyPlayersRolls array to store every player's rolls
- double for loop below can make into a helper function
storeEveryPlayerRolls (howManyPlayers, howManyDice)
for (var i = 0; i < numOfPlayers; i++) {
	var onePlayerRoll = [];
  for (var j = 0; j < numOfDice; j++) {
    onePlayerRoll[j] = rollDice();
  }
  allPlayersRolls[i] = onePlayerRoll;
}
return allPlayersRolls;
- everyPlayersRolls = storeEveryPlayerRolls(numOfPlayers, numOfDice);
- for output
for (var i = 0; i < numOfPlayers; i++) {
	output = output + "Player ${i+1} rolled ${everyPlayersRolls[i]}<br>";
}
output = output + "Press Submit to generate the numbers"
gameState = "generateNums"

3. generateNums
- global array everyPlayersFinalNum
- reassign each array inside everyPlayersRolls to the sorted one
- need to add if (gameMode = "normal") to differentiate the two codes
for (var i = 0; i < numOfPlayers; i++) {
	everyPlayersRolls[i] = everyPlayersRolls[i].sort(compare);
	everyPlayersFinalNum[i] = Number(everyPlayersRolls[i].join(""));
	output = output + "Player ${i+1} final number is ${everyPlayersFinalNum[i]}<br>";
}
- else the lowest game mode, just reverse() and reassign
for (var i = 0; i < numOfPlayers; i++) {
	everyPlayersRolls[i] = everyPlayersRolls[i].reverse();
	everyPlayersFinalNum[i] = Number(everyPlayersRolls[i].join(""));
	output = output + "Player ${i+1} final number is ${everyPlayersFinalNum[i]}<br>";
}
output = output + `Restart the game by choosing game mode "normal" or "lowest"`
gameState = "chooseGameMode"

4. checkResult
- need to use objects which we haven't learned
- can come back to this when i've got the knowledge and time
