# Rocket Academy Coding Basics: Beat That!

This implementation includes the following:

<ul> Features:
  <li> Score </li>
  <li> Leaderboard </li>
</ul>

<ul> Game Mode Modifiers
  <li> Lowest Combined Mode			(--lowestCombined)</li>
  <li> Auto-Generate Mode 			(--auto)</li>
  <li> Variable Number of Dice 		(--vDiceN)</li>
</ul>

Modifiers must be applied in the start line with their respective flag, as indicated in the parentheses above. Multiple modifiers can be applied in each game, but the Variable Number of Dice modifier only works with the Auto-Generate modifier enabled. Similar to command-line programs such as [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/), all modifiers must be declared at the same time. 

An example of a working start command would be `start --auto --vDice6`.
